# fs.watchFile(filename[, options], listener)

    description: The `filename` parameter can be a WHATWG `URL` object using
                 `file:` protocol. Support is currently still *experimental*.
-->

* `filename` {string|Buffer|URL}
* `options` {Object}
  * `persistent` {boolean}
  * `interval` {integer}
* `listener` {Function}

Watch for changes on `filename`. The callback `listener` will be called each
time the file is accessed.

The `options` argument may be omitted. If provided, it should be an object. The
`options` object may contain a boolean named `persistent` that indicates
whether the process should continue to run as long as files are being watched.
The `options` object may specify an `interval` property indicating how often the
target should be polled in milliseconds. The default is
`{ persistent: true, interval: 5007 }`.

The `listener` gets two arguments the current stat object and the previous
stat object:

```js
fs.watchFile('message.text', (curr, prev) => {
  console.log(`the current mtime is: ${curr.mtime}`);
  console.log(`the previous mtime was: ${prev.mtime}`);
});
```

These stat objects are instances of `fs.Stat`.

To be notified when the file was modified, not just accessed, it is necessary
to compare `curr.mtime` and `prev.mtime`.

*Note*: When an `fs.watchFile` operation results in an `ENOENT` error, it
will invoke the listener once, with all the fields zeroed (or, for dates, the
Unix Epoch). In Windows, `blksize` and `blocks` fields will be `undefined`,
instead of zero. If the file is created later on, the listener will be called
again, with the latest stat objects. This is a change in functionality since
v0.10.

*Note*: [`fs.watch()`][] is more efficient than `fs.watchFile` and
`fs.unwatchFile`. `fs.watch` should be used instead of `fs.watchFile` and
`fs.unwatchFile` when possible.
