* `path` {string|Buffer|URL}
* `options` {string|Object}
  * `encoding` {string} **Default:** `'utf8'`

Synchronous realpath(3). Returns the resolved path.

Only paths that can be converted to UTF8 strings are supported.

The optional `options` argument can be a string specifying an encoding, or an
object with an `encoding` property specifying the character encoding to use for
the returned value. If the `encoding` is set to `'buffer'`, the path returned
will be passed as a `Buffer` object.

*Note*: If `path` resolves to a socket or a pipe, the function will return a
system dependent name for that object.
