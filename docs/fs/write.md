* `fd` {integer}
* `buffer` {Buffer|Uint8Array}
* `offset` {integer}
* `length` {integer}
* `position` {integer}
* `callback` {Function}

Write `buffer` to the file specified by `fd`.

`offset` determines the part of the buffer to be written, and `length` is
an integer specifying the number of bytes to write.

`position` refers to the offset from the beginning of the file where this data
should be written. If `typeof position !== 'number'`, the data will be written
at the current position. See pwrite(2).

The callback will be given three arguments `(err, bytesWritten, buffer)` where
`bytesWritten` specifies how many _bytes_ were written from `buffer`.

If this method is invoked as its [`util.promisify()`][]ed version, it returns
a Promise for an object with `bytesWritten` and `buffer` properties.

Note that it is unsafe to use `fs.write` multiple times on the same file
without waiting for the callback. For this scenario,
`fs.createWriteStream` is strongly recommended.

On Linux, positional writes don't work when the file is opened in append mode.
The kernel ignores the position argument and always appends the data to
the end of the file.

# fs.write(fd, string[, position[, encoding]], callback)

* `fd` {integer}
* `string` {string}
* `position` {integer}
* `encoding` {string}
* `callback` {Function}

Write `string` to the file specified by `fd`.  If `string` is not a string, then
the value will be coerced to one.

`position` refers to the offset from the beginning of the file where this data
should be written. If `typeof position !== 'number'` the data will be written at
the current position. See pwrite(2).

`encoding` is the expected string encoding.

The callback will receive the arguments `(err, written, string)` where `written`
specifies how many _bytes_ the passed string required to be written. Note that
bytes written is not the same as string characters. See [`Buffer.byteLength`][].

Unlike when writing `buffer`, the entire string must be written. No substring
may be specified. This is because the byte offset of the resulting data may not
be the same as the string offset.

Note that it is unsafe to use `fs.write` multiple times on the same file
without waiting for the callback. For this scenario,
`fs.createWriteStream` is strongly recommended.

On Linux, positional writes don't work when the file is opened in append mode.
The kernel ignores the position argument and always appends the data to
the end of the file.
