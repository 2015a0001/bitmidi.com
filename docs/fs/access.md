# fs.access(path[, mode], callback)

<!-- YAML
added: v0.11.15
changes:
  - version: v7.6.0
    pr-url: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/10739
    description: The `path` parameter can be a WHATWG `URL` object using `file:`
                 protocol. Support is currently still *experimental*.
  - version: v6.3.0
    pr-url: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/6534
    description: The constants like `fs.R_OK`, etc which were present directly
                 on `fs` were moved into `fs.constants` as a soft deprecation.
                 Thus for Node `< v6.3.0` use `fs` to access those constants, or
                 do something like `(fs.constants || fs).R_OK` to work with all
                 versions.
-->

* `path` {string|Buffer|URL}
* `mode` {integer}
* `callback` {Function}

Tests a user's permissions for the file or directory specified by `path`.
The `mode` argument is an optional integer that specifies the accessibility
checks to be performed. The following constants define the possible values of
`mode`. It is possible to create a mask consisting of the bitwise OR of two or
more values.

- `fs.constants.F_OK` - `path` is visible to the calling process. This is useful
for determining if a file exists, but says nothing about `rwx` permissions.
Default if no `mode` is specified.
- `fs.constants.R_OK` - `path` can be read by the calling process.
- `fs.constants.W_OK` - `path` can be written by the calling process.
- `fs.constants.X_OK` - `path` can be executed by the calling process. This has
no effect on Windows (will behave like `fs.constants.F_OK`).

The final argument, `callback`, is a callback function that is invoked with
a possible error argument. If any of the accessibility checks fail, the error
argument will be populated. The following example checks if the file
`/etc/passwd` can be read and written by the current process.

```js
fs.access('/etc/passwd', fs.constants.R_OK | fs.constants.W_OK, (err) => {
  console.log(err ? 'no access!' : 'can read/write');
});
```

Using `fs.access()` to check for the accessibility of a file before calling
`fs.open()`, `fs.readFile()` or `fs.writeFile()` is not recommended. Doing
so introduces a race condition, since other processes may change the file's
state between the two calls. Instead, user code should open/read/write the
file directly and handle the error raised if the file is not accessible.

For example:


**write (NOT RECOMMENDED)**

```js
fs.access('myfile', (err) => {
  if (!err) {
    console.error('myfile already exists');
    return;
  }

  fs.open('myfile', 'wx', (err, fd) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    writeMyData(fd);
  });
});
```

**write (RECOMMENDED)**

```js
fs.open('myfile', 'wx', (err, fd) => {
  if (err) {
    if (err.code === 'EEXIST') {
      console.error('myfile already exists');
      return;
    }

    throw err;
  }

  writeMyData(fd);
});
```

**read (NOT RECOMMENDED)**

```js
fs.access('myfile', (err) => {
  if (err) {
    if (err.code === 'ENOENT') {
      console.error('myfile does not exist');
      return;
    }

    throw err;
  }

  fs.open('myfile', 'r', (err, fd) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    readMyData(fd);
  });
});
```

**read (RECOMMENDED)**

```js
fs.open('myfile', 'r', (err, fd) => {
  if (err) {
    if (err.code === 'ENOENT') {
      console.error('myfile does not exist');
      return;
    }

    throw err;
  }

  readMyData(fd);
});
```

The "not recommended" examples above check for accessibility and then use the
file; the "recommended" examples are better because they use the file directly
and handle the error, if any.

In general, check for the accessibility of a file only if the file wonâ€™t be
used directly, for example when its accessibility is a signal from another
process.
