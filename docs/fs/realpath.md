* `path` {string|Buffer|URL}
* `options` {string|Object}
  * `encoding` {string} default = `'utf8'`
* `callback` {Function}

Asynchronous realpath(3). The `callback` gets two arguments `(err,
resolvedPath)`. May use `process.cwd` to resolve relative paths.

Only paths that can be converted to UTF8 strings are supported.

The optional `options` argument can be a string specifying an encoding, or an
object with an `encoding` property specifying the character encoding to use for
the path passed to the callback. If the `encoding` is set to `'buffer'`,
the path returned will be passed as a `Buffer` object.

*Note*: If `path` resolves to a socket or a pipe, the function will return a
system dependent name for that object.
